&lt;p>The term &amp;ldquo;Security Champion&amp;rdquo; has become an established concept to encompass people who do not necessarily work directly with security but can act as a bridge between formal security roles and development teams.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are many ways to implement a Security Champion program; OWASP has a &lt;a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-security-culture/stable/4-Security_Champions/">relatively comprehensive list&lt;/a> of points for a program where Security Champions have a more formal role. At Bouvet, we have chosen a different solution inspired by &lt;a href="https://sikkerhet.nav.no/docs/bli-security-champion/">NAV&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://equinor.github.io/appsec/security-champion/">Equinor&lt;/a> where it is more informal, and each person can contribute as much as they can and have the capacity for.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Security Champion Role</title><link>https://chrish.github.io/sikkerhet.bouvet.no/security-champion/the-security-champion-role/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chrish.github.io/sikkerhet.bouvet.no/security-champion/the-security-champion-role/</guid><description>&lt;p>Regardless of your background (developer, tester, project manager, etc.), points 1, 2, and 3 can be done by everyone.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You can start by asking yourself a few questions:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>What does this project I am working on actually do?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is critical for the system to function?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How can this system be misused, what attack surfaces exist in the system?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Is there an updated threat model with corresponding measures to prevent the exploitation of weaknesses?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As you begin to create awareness, you can move on to find out more. Now you can start taking some initiative in your team.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Contributing outside the team</title><link>https://chrish.github.io/sikkerhet.bouvet.no/security-champion/contributing-outside-the-team/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chrish.github.io/sikkerhet.bouvet.no/security-champion/contributing-outside-the-team/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="get-involved-with-regional-security-champions">Get Involved with Regional Security Champions&lt;a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#get-involved-with-regional-security-champions" aria-label="Heading self-link">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Most regions in Bouvet have their own Security Champions gatherings on a regular basis, where knowledge, tips, tricks, and much more are shared. Get involved here and help build a regional security culture in the developer teams!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All developers should be familiar with the basic principles of security and secure development, but to achieve this, we need to go out among people and share knowledge. &lt;a href="en/develop/security_practices">OWASP Top 10&lt;/a> is always relevant, so if you feel like it - set up a session with colleagues in the surrounding units. You can make it super fancy and run demos of every single point, but you can just as easily make it low-threshold and simply talk through the points.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
