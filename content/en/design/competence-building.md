title: "Competence Building"

description: >
  Having the right competence is crucial for all teams, especially when it comes to security. The team must identify any gaps they have, so that measures such as training can be implemented to cover these gaps.
---

Security is an unknown and perhaps somewhat intimidating area for many, where they don't quite know where to start. Therefore, when a new project is initiated, it is important to assess the need for competence building among team members. Initially, this is aimed at topics related to security, but the use of new technology can also pose a risk if used incorrectly.

It is important that the team reviews the entire development process in all phases and evaluates each point against what the team knows, what is relevant for the project, and where assistance can be obtained.

We have many different security environments and individuals with high competence who can contribute within Bouvet; if your team needs help, feel free to bring it up in your local Security Champions channel on Bouvet-Slack, ```#sikkerhet``` or with your regional quality leader.


## Training courses
Bouvet offers training courses in many different areas, also including security. If your team needs training outside of what Security Journey has to offer, this might be an option. Please contact the [training department](https://kurs.bouvet.no) if you cannot find a suitable training course. 

## Security Journey
Bouvet has purchased licenses for Security Journey, which offers security-related training in many different areas. Each training course consists of multiple modules, which contains either a video+text followed by a short quiz, _or_ a coding challenge which gives you VS Code, a proxy and a browser. The coding challenges can be solved using any of the major programming languages, ensuring that most developers should be comfortable giving them a try. All training courses are delivered through your browser, and requires no local installation.

Below is a list of the most relevant training courses for us. We're currently deploying the platform, more information on how to obtain a license will be published on Min Side in the near future.
