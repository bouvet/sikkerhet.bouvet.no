  Are you a new employee at Bouvet? Here you'll find information about how we handle security in our deliveries, and how you can get started yourself.

As a new employee at Bouvet, there’s a lot to get familiar with. Security in our deliveries and projects is primarily handled by the delivery team – they’re the ones who know the solutions and the customer best.

Security should be part of the craft we deliver – regardless of context. As an employee, you need to understand how security affects your role and your tasks, but don’t be afraid to ask those around you or your nearest Security Champion.

## Security Training

We have a security policy that applies to all employees at Bouvet. As an employee, you are expected to go through basic security training in the tool _Security Journey_ – go to [my.securityjourney.com](https://my.securityjourney.com/) and log in.

Depending on your role, there may be other courses that are useful and relevant. If you are a developer, you must complete the course _"OWASP Top 10 - Web Applications"_ – this is a fundamental course that walks you through the most common threats related to web apps.

## Help – I’m stuck!

If you’re stuck somewhere, or are unsure – phone a friend. Talk with your immediate manager, local Security Champions, or use Slack. The channel `#security-journey-support` was created to support the use of Security Journey – you will certainly find someone there who can help.
