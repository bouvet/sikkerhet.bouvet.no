            A Security Champion is a person who acts as a driving force and motivator for security work within a team or department/unit. The responsibility for security lies with the team as a whole, but as a Security Champion, you contribute to awareness and focus.

            Simply put, a Security Champion is an ambassador for security, the team's security conscience.
