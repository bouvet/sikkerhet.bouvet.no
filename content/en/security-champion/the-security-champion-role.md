## What does a Security Champion do?
As a Security Champion, you are expected to acquire new knowledge and stay up to date. You are the spearhead for security within the delivery and, together with the delivery manager, you must ensure that we deliver in accordance with Bouvet’s best practices – documented with [the checklist]({{< ref "checklist.md" >}}) here on sikkerhet.bouvet.no.

As a Security Champion, it is not always easy to know where to begin. To get off to a good start, we’ve tried to summarize three points you can use as a starting point.

### Get to know the project
Start by asking yourself a few questions:

* What is the purpose of the project?
* Does the team have any existing security routines or documentation?
* How can this product be misused, what attack surfaces or information does it contain?

Feel free to use [the checklist]({{< ref "checklist.md" >}}) as a basis for reflection. Talk to others on the team, and try to find out what the team has done previously, and what information is available.

### Do we have control of our project?
[The checklist]({{< ref "checklist.md" >}}) is Bouvet’s best practice for development projects and should be used unless the delivery or the customer requires another framework. Are we following the points described in it – or have we assessed the risk if we disregard some of those points?

If yes, you as a Security Champion should go through and familiarize yourself with the information. Important details here include when it was last updated or revised, and what routines the team has in place to keep it updated. If no, you as a Security Champion should talk to the delivery manager to see how, together, you can establish good routines for documenting and regularly reviewing this information.

You don’t need to solve everything on day one; the important thing is to get started and to raise any findings or shortcomings with the team, add them to the backlog, and prioritize them alongside other tasks that need to be completed.

### Establish good routines
Not everyone is interested in security work – people have different interests and backgrounds. However, security is an important part of the quality of the craft we deliver, so it’s crucial that the team is involved in the work and that good routines are established, which depend as little as possible on individuals. As a Security Champion, you follow up on security issues on behalf of the team, and you ensure the team gets the answers they need.

### What if the security work stalls?
There can be many reasons why security work stalls – a common example is when the customer insists on delivering functionality first and security “later.” Just like testing and UX, security is an integrated part of the development process – it’s not something to slap on afterwards without affecting quality or cost.

If the security work stalls, you as the Security Champion should first discuss it with the delivery manager, and then with your regional quality manager if the delivery manager is unable to influence the situation. Security work is important – we do not want to end up on the front page of the newspapers because we didn’t do our job!

### What if I’m stuck?
If you as a Security Champion are unsure what to do and feel like you’re getting nowhere – talk to the delivery manager or your unit manager, or get in touch with other Security Champions! Use the Slack channel ```#security-champions``` to reach other Security Champions, or contact one of the members of [the core group for Security Champions at Bouvet]({{< ref "security-champion/what-is-a-security-champion.md#who-leads-security-champion-at-bouvet" >}})
