## Why "Security Champion"
The term "Security Champion" has become an established concept to encompass people who work with security in the context of their profession – a security advocate. They are not solely security experts, but they have an interest, engagement, and competence in security as it relates to the tasks they typically perform. At Bouvet, the delivery manager is formally responsible for security in the delivery, but they need resources to lean on – a Security Champion is one such resource!

There are many ways to implement a Security Champion program; at Bouvet, we have chosen an approach reminiscent of [the description from OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-project-security-culture/stable/4-Security_Champions/) where Security Champions have a more formal role in the deliveries. Other organizations have a looser approach – but the goal is the same: Employees who bring security into all their work so that, overall, we can deliver at a higher level of quality!

## How do you become a Security Champion?
The intention is that everyone should have the _opportunity_ to become a Security Champion! However, to function in the role, you must at least complete the first of four courses set up for Security Champions in Bouvet's e-learning platform, Security Journey. This course covers several modules on basic topics and is useful for everyone – regardless of background. You don’t need to be a developer – the modules in this first course consist solely of video lessons/articles, followed by a quiz. Since the Security Champion role requires some effort, it’s important to clarify with your immediate manager how this will be managed, so you have the necessary leeway to function effectively in the delivery.

**Remember:** _A Security Champion should not be a security expert, but must bring some security competence into the team and have a desire to learn more!_
