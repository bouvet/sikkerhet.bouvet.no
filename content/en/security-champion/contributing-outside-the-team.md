  If you’re interested in raising the security culture beyond your team, get involved!

At Bouvet, we love sharing! There are many internal forums where you can contribute to share knowledge, experience, and more with your colleagues.

## AppSec-Caffeine
This is a gathering held every month, with physical meeting rooms booked in Stavanger and Oslo for those who wish to attend in person. For everyone else, the gathering is available via Teams. The sessions last about an hour, and they follow the same format every time:
* Security news
* Security-related talk or presentation
* Security quiz

These gatherings are open to anyone at Bouvet who wants to participate (but check in with your nearest manager regarding time registration), but we expect Security Champions to attend since this is the only regular meeting point we have for Security Champions across Bouvet. A new schedule is set each fall; contact one of the members of the steering group if you’re interested in contributing a presentation! The Slack channels ```#security-champions``` and ```#sikkerhet``` are actively used to share information, and this is also where we announce events—both regionally and across the company.

## Bouvet One
At Bouvet, we hold regular gatherings—Bouvet One—where we host talks on everything under the sun, often with dedicated security tracks. We have also had dedicated Bouvet One events specifically for security. Everyone is free to contribute—any talk is appreciated, no matter how simple you think it might be—there will always be _someone_ hearing about your topic for the first time!

...a beloved child has many names. There are many smaller local events where people gather to learn about various topics. Keep an eye on your local office to see what’s happening, and how exactly **you** can contribute.

## Get involved nationally
There is a [national Security Champions community](https://securitychampions.no/) where you can get involved and meet like-minded people. Several conferences and user groups in Norway are also related to security, where it’s possible to contribute, for example:
* [Sikkerhetsfestivalen (Lillehammer)](https://sikkerhetsfestivalen.no/)
* [NDC Security (Oslo)](https://ndc-security.com/)
* [Stavanger Security Hangout (Stavanger)](https://www.meetup.com/stavanger-security-hangout/)
