            Once the solution is designed and the code is written, it's "just" about deploying, and then we're done, right? We often use CI/CD solutions to build and deploy, run tests, and much more.
            If someone can compromise pipelines, the build agent building the solution, or the connection to the resources we deploy to, we will have major problems.
