            "If it builds, we can ship it!" is a widely known saying within the IT-world, but unfortunately reality isn't that simple!

            Any project building a system today will probably have to relate to the [CI/CD](ci-cd.md) process!
            Within our context we have to focus on the security of this process, and not just that it's working.

            Many of todays solutions runs in the cloud or on containers, in hybrid architectures or other environments. Regardless of how it's going to run, the build process can help uncover new issues with the software itself, the underlying infrastructure or test for regressions. All teams needs to understand how this process works, so that it can be utilized to help you deliver a better product.
