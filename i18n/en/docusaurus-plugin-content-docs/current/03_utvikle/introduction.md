            It's not possible to provide a recipe on how to write secure code in a few simple and concise articles. However, it doesn't mean it's an insurmountable task reserved only for security experts! Everyone developing software at Bouvet should be familiar with <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/">OWASP Top 10</a>, which is a good starting point to understand the challenges faced by developers.

            The articles you find under the topic <b>Utvikle</b> on this page will focus on what happens on a developer's workstation, apart from actual code. They won't delve into specific attack methods or how to defend against them. You will also find advice on how a team should work to prevent, identify, and fix vulnerable code.
