# Runbook

import WorkInProgress from '../_work_in_progress.mdx'

<WorkInProgress />

A _runbook_ is a document specifying the operational procedures of the system, its components, architecture and daily operations for an operations team. This should be a living document updated on a regular basis to reflect lessons learned from experience, incident post-mortems and so on. This is particularly important in cases where several teams might be involved:

- A part-time Bouvet DevOps team handles operations when working for the client
- The clients own infrastructure team handles any servers, network and other infra
- The client help desk might handle operations when the DevOps team is unavailable
- On-call IT personell handles operational issues outside office hours
