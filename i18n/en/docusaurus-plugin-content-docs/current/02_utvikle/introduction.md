            Creating a guide on how to write secure code in a few short and understandable articles is not an easy task. That does not mean that we shouldn't try, or that you have to be a security expert to do so. Anyone writing code in Bouvet should be familiar with <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/">OWASP Top 10</a> at a minimum, as this gives a good entry level view for knowing which vulnerabilities we face as developers.

            The articles you'll find under the heading <b>Develop</b> on this page will focus on the activities taking place on a developers workstation which isn't coding. They will not go in-depth on specific attack vectors, techniques or how to prevent against these. Instead, you'll find good general advice on how to obtain the knowledge needed for your project and the tools that will help you on the way to delivering secure code.
