# Competence Building
:::tip In Short
Having the right competence is crucial for all teams, especially when it comes to security. The team must identify any gaps they have, so that measures such as training can be implemented to cover these gaps.
:::

Security is an unknown and perhaps somewhat intimidating area for many, where they don't quite know where to start. Therefore, when a new project is initiated, it is important to assess the need for competence building among team members. Initially, this is aimed at topics related to security, but the use of new technology can also pose a risk if used incorrectly.

It is important that the team reviews the entire development process in all phases and evaluates each point against what the team knows, what is relevant for the project, and where assistance can be obtained.

We have many different security environments and individuals with high competence who can contribute within Bouvet; if your team needs help, feel free to bring it up in your local Security Champions channel on Bouvet-Slack, ```#sikkerhet``` or with your regional quality leader.
