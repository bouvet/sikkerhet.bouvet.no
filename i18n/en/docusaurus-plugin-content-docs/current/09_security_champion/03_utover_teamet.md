# What a Security Champion Does Beyond the Team

If you are interested in raising the security culture beyond the team, get involved! At Bouvet, we hold regular gatherings - Bouvet ONE - where we host talks on everything under the sun, often with dedicated security tracks. We have also held specific Bouvet ONE events dedicated to security. Here, everyone is free to contribute - all talks are appreciated, no matter how simple you might think your topic is.

## Get Involved with Regional Security Champions

Most regions in Bouvet have their own Security Champions gatherings on a regular basis, where knowledge, tips, tricks, and much more are shared. Get involved here and help build a regional security culture in the developer teams!

All developers should be familiar with the basic principles of security and secure development, but to achieve this, we need to go out among people and share knowledge. [OWASP Top 10](../03_develop/04_sikkerhetspraksiser) is always relevant, so if you feel like it - set up a session with colleagues in the surrounding units. You can make it super fancy and run demos of every single point, but you can just as easily make it low-threshold and simply talk through the points.

The most important thing is that you engage and help spread knowledge!

## Get Involved Nationally

There is a <Link to="https://securitychampions.no/">national Security Champions community</Link> where you can get involved to meet like-minded individuals. Several conferences and user groups in Norway related to security offer opportunities to contribute, such as:
* <Link to="https://sikkerhetsfestivalen.no/">Sikkerhetsfestivalen (Lillehammer)</Link>
* <Link to="https://ndc-security.com/">NDC Security (Oslo)</Link>
* <Link to="https://www.meetup.com/stavanger-security-hangout/">Stavanger Security Hangout (Stavanger)</Link>
