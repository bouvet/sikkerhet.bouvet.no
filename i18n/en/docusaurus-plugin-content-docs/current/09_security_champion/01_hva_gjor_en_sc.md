# Bouvet Security Champion

A Security Champion is not a defined role in Bouvet; it is simply a person who is passionate about security and helps to focus on security in our deliveries. Anyone can become a Security Champion - if you want to, you can!

## Why "Security Champion"

The term "Security Champion" has become an established concept to encompass people who do not necessarily work directly with security but can act as a bridge between formal security roles and development teams.

There are many ways to implement a Security Champion program; OWASP has a [relatively comprehensive list](https://owasp.org/www-project-security-culture/stable/4-Security_Champions/) of points for a program where Security Champions have a more formal role. At Bouvet, we have chosen a different solution inspired by [NAV](https://sikkerhet.nav.no/docs/bli-security-champion/) and [Equinor](https://equinor.github.io/appsec/security-champion/) where it is more informal, and each person can contribute as much as they can and have the capacity for.

# What does a Security Champion do?

This will vary between regions, units, and teams, but largely it is up to each Security Champion to decide how much they can engage beyond their own project. The Slack channel ```#security-champions``` is used to announce events, share useful information and anything else related to Security Champions in Bouvet.  


In addition, many use the Slack channel `#sikkerhet` to share news, ask questions, or post tips and tricks. Some regions also have regular meetings for all Security Champions, in addition to arranging courses, meetups, lectures, and much more.

Bouvet is becoming a large company with a wide range of projects we work on, and security is a vast area where everyone has something new to learn every day. We love sharing knowledge, so it's great if _YOU_ want to get involved and share what you know with others - no matter how low or high the threshold for understanding might be.

And most importantly, we primarily sell competence, and more engaged Security Champions is never a negative thing. If you are unsure about what you are allowed to do or not, talk to your nearest manager and other Security Champions in the region, and you will surely find a solution.
