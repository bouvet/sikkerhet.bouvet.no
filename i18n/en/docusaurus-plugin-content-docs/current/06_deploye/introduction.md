            Deploying or releasing the software often includes multiple platforms and environments. Many projects will run their software in the cloud, either as Cloud Native solutions or through the use of containers. Others will create their own virtual machines in a cloud service, and some  creates software for local installation. Regardless of platform or environment; having a focus on security is paramount and is something that cannot be ignored.

            Containers, virtual machines or other environments must be kept up-to-date and be secured. The end result should be the same regardless of platform, but the actual process will differ from environment to environment.
